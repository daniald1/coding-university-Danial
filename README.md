How to Run
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the Script:

bash
Copy code
python render_schedule.py --schedule=schedule.json --overrides=overrides.json --from='2023-11-17T17:00:00Z' --until='2023-12-01T17:00:00Z'
Demonstration Commands
Basic Usage:
bash
Copy code
python render_schedule.py --schedule=schedule.json --overrides=overrides.json --from='START_TIME' --until='END_TIME'
Replace START_TIME and END_TIME with desired datetime strings in ISO format.

Short Demonstration
Run with Sample Data:
bash
Copy code
python render_schedule.py --schedule=schedule.json --overrides=overrides.json --from='2023-11-17T17:00:00Z' --until='2023-12-01T17:00:00Z'
Additional Features
Updated Schedule Notifications
Make use of the logic that determines shifts and overrides in the render_schedule.py script.
When a new schedule is created or modified, add an integration layer to send notifications (for instance, Slack APIs).
We could include things like the start and end hours in the notification.
User Availability Could Be Included
Make the schedule longer. User availability information, like when they are available, can be included in a JSON format.
Modify the produce_schedule feature to exclude users when they are unavailable.
Insights and Analysis
Record data during schedule generation, including the overall amount of time spent on-call and the number of shifts allocated to each user, and then produce an analytics report.
Scaling for Serious Events
Include a function that allows on-call coverage to be scaled during high-severity situations using past data.
Create a machine learning tool to predict high-risk times.
Add more users during those crucial periods, or severity levels could be specified in the overrides.json file.
Timeline with Visual Schedule
Use a package such as matplotlib to generate a calendar visualization from the output of render_schedule.py (like the picture on GitHub).
Notes on Shift Handover
Include a notes field in the schedule after every shift.
Users can leave remarks for the following engineer during overrides or shift changes, such as events or incidents that took place, which could help the new user in their shift.
